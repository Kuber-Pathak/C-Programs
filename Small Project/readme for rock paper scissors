Rock,Paper,Scissors is a classic two-person game.
Players start each round by saying, “rock, paper, scissors”.
After “scissors” each player holds out their hand at the same time.
Fist is for rock, flat hand is for paper, or their index and middle finger is for scissors.
Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. 
See who wins each round!
